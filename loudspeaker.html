                                        There are many different kinds of drivers but they all do basically the same
                                        thing: create sound waves. By far the most common type of driver is the moving
                                        coil electrodynamic piston driver. It has a moving part called a diaphragm that
                                        acts like a piston to pump air and thereby create sound waves. A common
                                        diaphragm for a woofer is a paper cone. A common diaphragm for a tweeter is a
                                        fabric dome. <br><br>
                                        Drivers come in different sizes because it is nearly impossible to make one
                                        piston driver that can reproduce sound waves over the entire 20 Hz to 20 kHz
                                        frequency range of human hearing. To produce low frequencies a driver needs to
                                        have a large diaphragm and enough mass to resonate at a low frequency. To
                                        produce high frequencies a driver needs to have a small diaphragm with a low
                                        mass. Obviously, these requirements are in opposition so drivers are usually
                                        designed to produce only a portion of the sound. <br><br>
                                        Tweeters are the smaller drivers since they produce the highest frequencies with
                                        the shortest wavelengths. Woofers are the largest drivers since they produce the
                                        lowest frequencies with the longest wavelengths. <br><br>
                                        There are also midrange drivers of various sizes that reproduce middle
                                        frequencies between the tweeter and woofer. Midrange drivers are used in
                                        multi-way speakers with three or more driver sizes. Some have open backs and
                                        some have sealed backs.
                                        Besides their different size, there is another very significant difference
                                        between a tweeter and a woofer. The tweeter usually has a sealed back while the
                                        woofer usually has an open back. With a sealed back, the tweeter emits sound
                                        waves from the front side only. A woofer emits sound waves from both its front
                                        and back side.
                                        <br><br>

                                        To understand how speakers work, you first need to understand how
                                        <strong>sound</strong>
                                        works.
                                        <br>
                                        Inside your ear is a very thin piece of skin called the eardrum. When your
                                        eardrum vibrates, your brain interprets the vibrations as sound - that's how you
                                        hear. Rapid changes in air pressure are the most common thing to vibrate your
                                        eardrum. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        An object produces sound when it vibrates in air (sound can also travel through
                                        liquids and solids, but air is the transmission medium when we listen to
                                        speakers). When something vibrates, it moves the air particles around it. Those
                                        air particles in turn move the air particles around them, carrying the pulse of
                                        the vibration through the air as a traveling disturbance. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        To see how this works, let's look at a simple vibrating object -- a bell. When
                                        you ring a bell, the metal vibrates -- flexes in and out -- rapidly. When it
                                        flexes out on one side, it pushes out on the surrounding air particles on that
                                        side. These air particles then collide with the particles in front of them,
                                        which collide with the particles in front of them and so on. When the bell
                                        flexes away, it pulls in on these surrounding air particles, creating a drop in
                                        pressure that pulls in on more surrounding air particles, which creates another
                                        drop in pressure that pulls in particles that are even farther out and so on.
                                        This decreasing of pressure is called <strong>rarefaction</strong>. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In this way, a vibrating object sends a <strong>wave</strong> of pressure
                                        fluctuation
                                        through the atmosphere. When the fluctuation wave reaches your ear, it vibrates
                                        the eardrum back and forth. Our brain interprets this motion as sound.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <center><h2><i>Differentiating Sound:</i></h2></center>
                                        We hear different sounds from different vibrating objects because of variations
                                        in:

                                                pressure fluctuates faster. We hear this as a higher pitch. When there
                                                are fewer fluctuations in a period of time, the pitch is lower.

                                                loud the sound is. Sound waves with greater amplitudes move our ear
                                                drums more, and we register this sensation as a higher volume.

                                        learned that microphones translate sound waves into electrical signals, which
                                        can be encoded onto CDs, tapes, LPs, etc. Players convert this stored
                                        information back into an electric current for use in the stereo system. <br>

                                        A speaker is essentially the final translation machine -- the reverse of the

                            <br>
                            The voice coil is a basic electromagnet. <strong>When the electrical current flowing through
                                the
                                voice coil changes direction, the coil's polar orientation reverses.</strong><br>
                        <p> Running electrical current through the wire creates a magnetic field around the coil,
                            magnetizing the metal it is wrapped around. The field acts just like the magnetic field
                            around a permanent magnet: It has a polar orientation -- a "north" end and and a "south" end
                            -- and it is attracted to iron objects. But unlike a permanent magnet, in an electromagnet
                            you can alter the orientation of the poles. If you reverse the flow of the current, the
                            north and south ends of the electromagnet switch. </p>
                        <p> This is exactly what a signal does -- it constantly <strong>reverses the flow of
                            electricity</strong>.
                            If you've ever hooked up a stereo system, then you know that there are two output wires for
                            each speaker -- typically a black one and a red one. <br>
                            <br>
                            Essentially, the amplifier is constantly switching the electrical signal, fluctuating
                            between a positive charge and a negative charge on the red wire. Since electrons always flow
                            in the same direction between positively charged particles and negatively charged particles,
                            the current going through the speaker moves one way and then reverses and flows the other
                            way. This alternating current causes the polar orientation of the electromagnet to reverse
                            itself many times a second. <BR>

                        <center><h2><i>Magnets:</i></h2></center>
                        So how does the fluctuation make the speaker coil move back and forth? The electromagnet is
                        positioned in a constant magnetic field created by a <strong>permanent magnet</strong>. These
                        two magnets
                        -- the electromagnet and the permanent magnet -- interact with each other as any two magnets do.
                        The positive end of the electromagnet is attracted to the negative pole of the permanent
                        magnetic field, and the negative pole of the electromagnet is repelled by the permanent magnet's
                        negative pole. When the electromagnet's polar orientation switches, so does the direction of
                        repulsion and attraction. In this way, the alternating current constantly reverses the magnetic
                        forces between the voice coil and the permanent magnet. This pushes the coil back and forth
                        rapidly, like a piston. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>When the electrical current flowing through the voice coil changes direction, the coil's
                            polar orientation reverses. This changes the magnetic forces between the voice coil and the
                            permanent magnet, moving the coil and attached diaphragm back and forth.</strong><br>
                        <p> When the coil moves, it pushes and pulls on the speaker cone. This vibrates the air in front
                            of the speaker, creating sound waves. The electrical audio signal can also be interpreted as
                            a <strong>wave</strong>. The frequency and amplitude of this wave, which represents the
                            original sound
                            wave, dictates the rate and distance that the voice coil moves. This, in turn, determines
                            the frequency and amplitude of the sound waves produced by the diaphragm. </p>
                        <p> Different driver sizes are better suited for certain frequency ranges. For this reason,
                            loudspeaker units typically divide a wide frequency range among <strong>multiple
                                drivers</strong>. In
                            the next section, we'll find out how speakers divide up the frequency range, and we'll look
                            at the main driver types used in loudspeakers. <br>

                        Moving-coil loudspeaker drivers have been in use for several decades. They were
                        originally invented by Kellogg and Rice (circa 1920). A cutaway view of a movingcoil
                        loudspeaker driver typical of modern designs is shown in Fig. 1.0 <br>

                        <br>
                        The behavior of a driver is governed by basic principles of
                        physics. An alternating current is supplied to the leads of the driver. These leads are
                        connected to a wire that wraps around a coil former, creating what is known as the voice
                        coil. The coil has an electrical resistance and inductance associated with it. It is
                        positioned within the gap created between a hollow cylindrical magnet (e.g., north pole)
                        and a solid cylindrical pole piece (e.g., south pole). The latter is located within the
                        hollow coil former. Current applied to the voice coil flows in a circular direction around
                        the windings. The magnet structure provides magnetic flux through the coil with field
                        lines running perpendicular to the direction of current flow. <br>
                        <br>
                        As is well known in the study of electromagnetism, if a current flows in the
                        presence of a magnetic field, a Lorentz force is created. When applied to the geometry of
                        a moving-coil loudspeaker driver, the orthogonally oriented Lorentz Force simplifies to
                        the product of the effective magnetic flux density, the effective length of the coil in the
                        field, and the current flowing in the coil. Since the applied current alternates, the Lorentz
                        force likewise alternates, causing the voice coil (and anything attached to it) to oscillate
                        in an analogous manner. <br>
                        <br>
                        The voice coil is attached to the former, which is attached to a cone or diaphragm.
                        This diaphragm assembly is held in place by a suspension system that centers the voice
                        coil in the magnet gap. Suspension systems typically consist of two separate flexible
                        components: the surround and the spider. These spaced components serve to constrain
                        the cone vibrations to motion along a single axis and supply a restoring force to return the
                        cone to its rest position. The suspension system has a compliance and resistance
                        associated with it. The cone, coil former, voice coil, parts of the suspension system, and
                        lead wires ideally move in phase as lumped elements with a certain effective mass.
                        Oscillations of the cone produce fluctuations in air pressure that radiate away from the
                        driver as sound waves. <br>

                        <h2>Brief History of Moving-Coil Loudspeaker Modeling Development</h2>
                        Moving-coil loudspeaker drivers have been studied for years. McLachan first
                        developed equations governing moving-coil loudspeakers in the 1930s. <br>
                        In the 1940s,
                        Olson presented analogous circuits that represent the multiple domains of the movingcoil
                        driver. Later, in 1954, Beranek furthered the developments of Olson in his
                        development of a partial solution to the response of a bass-reflex loudspeaker system. <br>
                        In 1958, Novak presented a generalized theory on the design and performance of
                        vented and closed-box loudspeaker enclosures. However, Thiele is generally thought <br>
                        of as the first to develop a complete synthesis procedure for direct radiator loudspeakers.
                        Thiele's work was initially published in the 1961 Proceedings of the Institution of Radio
                        Engineers. It was then reprinted in the 1971 Journal of the Audio Engineering
                        Society (JAES). <br>
                        Between 1968 and 1972, Benson published a series of papers
                        building on previous work. Work done by Benson was not well known until Small
                        referenced his work. Small published papers in the internationally published
                        JAES, which brought recognition to both Benson's and Small's efforts.
                        A fundamental set of parameters that describe the lumped element model of a
                        moving-coil loudspeaker have been given the name Thiele/Small Parameters in
                        recognition of their work. <br>
                        Knowledge of these parameters is essential in the design of
                        complete loudspeaker systems. <br>

                            effectively forming a

                            of the cone causes changes in the air pressure in front of it, producing
                            sound energy. A well-designed speaker may only be around 5% efficient,
                            in other words, 20 watts of electrical power from an amplifier may only
                            result in 1 watt of sound power.</p>

                            of a loudspeaker in terms of dB SPL for 2.83 V input.The
                            sound pressure level is measured on-axis in anechoic conditions at a
                            distance of 1 metre from the loudspeaker. </p>
                        <p>2.83Volts corresponds to the voltage across a standard 8 ohms speaker driven at 1Watt.</p>

                            a guide to how good a speaker is. For instance a PA speaker will have
                            a sensitivity of around 115dB so sacrificing sound quality for high
                            output. Conversely a good monitor may be designed to ensure a flat frequency
                            response with components that also reduce sensitivity.</p>

                            of dB SPL/W/m where the power is the electrical input power. The older

                        <p>Although still commonly used efficiency is not as useful as voltage sensitivity
                            since input power is difficult to measure given input impedance is frequency
                            dependant, so for instance a lower frequency will have lower impedance
                            and suck more power, hence be less efficient. Also modern solid state
                            amps are voltage sources supplying current on demand so power is less
                            important than dB for volts.</p>

                        <p>The bass response of a loudspeaker can be improved by using back radiation.
                            Unfortunately, the front and back radiation is in anti-phase - we need
                            a &quot;phase inverter&quot; before it is possible to add the front
                            and back radiation constructively.</p>
                        <p>Such a strategy is achieved by the &quot;phase inverter&quot; family of loudspeaker
                            enclosures, which couple front and back radiation from the low frequency
                            unit(s) through an acoustic phase inverting network.</p>
                        <p>The phase inverter family includes </p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>In a bass reflex enclosure, the loudspeaker internally excites a Helmholtz resonator. This is
                            an acoustic network which has the amplitude and phase
                            response of a second order resonant system (which gives a phase inversion
                            above resonance).

                        </p>
                        <p>The bass reflex enclosure is a closed box enclosure with a
                            &quot;port&quot; in one of the enclosure walls. The port is a tube,
                            open at one end to the inside volume of the enclosure and open at the
                            other end to the listening space. Air in the port moves as a single
                            &quot;lumped mass&quot; which bounces up and down on the spring formed
                            by the volume of air trapped in the enclosure, giving the system a second
                            order resonant behaviour.</p>
                        <p>From resonant frequency upwards, the port radiation and the speaker radiation are
                            in phase (<em>so they add constructively giving more bass</em>). Below
                            resonance, the port and speaker radiation are out of phase (<em>so they
                                add destructively giving less bass than a closed box</em>) At the resonant frequency the
                            port response much greater than the 'speaker response (because the back load presented to
                            the loudspeaker is maximum at the resonance of the port.</p>

                            sound propagation becomes much more directional. This holds true for
