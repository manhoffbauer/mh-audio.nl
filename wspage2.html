	<h2><i>Set Anti Skating by ear</i></h2>
	That is a method that is widely used. 
	<br><br>
	You can play a number of test signals with the help of a test plate. 
	A good test plate, for example, is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HIFI-NEWS-Test-Producers-Cut/dp/B00KMCL1PE" target="blank"<i>HIFI News Test LP</i>.</a> <br><br>
	On this record are a number of signals with increasing modulation, 
	with which you can set the anti skating. Use headphones for this. However, the fact is that it is difficult for many people to 
	make a good observation. 
	<br><br>
	Then you could also measure with a scope. But you should just have that at your disposal.<br>
