<h2><i>Adjusting the Anti Skate Force</i></h2>

		What we do now is put the skate meter on the record player. The plumb bob hangs down from the start of the record position. 
		The headshell is hung with the finger lift on the other string. The needle hangs about 3 mm. above the plateau surface. 
		<br><br>
		Make sure you do not damage the needle here. Now the anti skate force can be applied after the arm lift is released. 
		<br><br>
		The reading is taken in tenths of an inch and is expressed as a percentage. <br><br>
		Optimal anti skate force are a values between 5 and 7%. <br>
		You could repeat this at the end of the record. The anti skate force may be slightly higher here (7-10%).

		<li>Put the skate meter on the record player</li><br>
		<li>The plumb bob hangs down from the start of the record position.
			Do not use a record or mat of any type (felt, cork, etc.) at this time.</li><br>
		<li>Make sure the Vertical Tracking Force is properly set.</li><br>
		<li>Affix the thread with the loop to the headshell fingerlift and adjust the length of the string so that the
			stylus hovers approximately 3mm above the platter. If you do not have a fingerlift, please use a strip
			of firm-holding tape to attach the string to the headshell at a point that is close as possible to the
			effective length distance (i.e., the horizontal location of the stylus from the pivot point of the
			tonearm.) The tonearm should be allowed to swing freely without the stylus touching the platter and
			without the tonearm touching the bottom bar of the WallySkater.</li><br>
		<li>Slide the top-bar slider (with strings attached) so that the cartridge is located at the outside edge of
			where the record would be.</li><br>
		<li>Adjust the anti-skating device on the tonearm so that the distance between the plumb bob and the
			string supporting the tonearm is 5 to 7 percent. (Each hash mark on the lower horizontal bar of the
			WallySkater equals one percent.)</li><br>
		<li>Move the slider towards the center of the platter and take another readout of the distance between the
			plumb bob and the string supporting the tonearm. Properly designed anti-skating devices should
			provide slightly higher percentages at this location – anywhere from 7 to 10 percent.</li>
			<!--
		<li>In order to determine the mechanical resistance of the tonearm, disengage the tonearm’s anti-skating
			device and move the slider from right to left, observing the distance between the plumb bob and the
			string holding the tonearm. The resistance generated by the tonearm wires, bearings, etc. should be no
			higher than 3 to 4 percent. Should the resistance of the tonearm measure higher than this, contact the
			manufacturer.</li>
